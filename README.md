The customer browses the online store and selects products to add to the shopping cart. After reviewing the cart, the customer proceeds to checkout, where they enter shipping and payment details. The system validates the information and processes the payment. Once payment is successful, the order is confirmed, inventory is updated, and the customer receives an order confirmation. The order is then prepared for shipping and delivery.
